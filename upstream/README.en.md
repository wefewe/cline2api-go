## Introduction

Cline2API is a reverse proxy for the Cline API with multi-account rotation, dual protocol support (OpenAI + Anthropic Messages API), API key authentication, and a bilingual admin panel (English/Chinese, auto-detected from your browser language with a manual toggle in the sidebar). A single-file cross-platform desktop app (Windows / macOS / Linux) is included — just download and run.

**Built with**: Go (backend + proxy + desktop shell), HTML/CSS/JS (embedded admin frontend).

## Features

- **Dual protocol**: serves both `/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI) and `/v1/messages` (Anthropic Messages API)
- **Multi-account rotation**: load-balances across Cline accounts (`round_robin` / `fill` / `random`)
- **Bilingual admin panel**: `/admin/` manages accounts, API keys, models, headers and proxy settings; auto-follows your browser language, manually switchable in the sidebar
- **Dynamic model sync**: fetches the official Cline recommended-models API on startup (free / cline-pass / recommended); a popup notifies you when the model list changes, and you can also click "Sync Models from Cline" in the panel anytime
- **Custom models**: add/remove model IDs manually and pick a default model (falls back to the first free model automatically)
- **API key auth**: protects proxy endpoints; generate/delete multiple API keys
- **System Prompt override**: place an `override.md` next to the executable to replace the system prompt for all requests
- **Account import/export**: OAuth login, manual tokens, batch file import, and cross-device export
- **Request logs**: per-request token usage, latency, TPS, and more
- **Desktop app**: single-file cross-platform app (Wails v2); closing the window stops the service

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Desktop app (recommended for sharing)

Download the executable for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/luawei1/cline2api/releases) and double-click it.

> On Windows, the SmartScreen "Windows protected your PC" warning is normal because no code-signing certificate is purchased. Click "More info → Run anyway".

| Platform | File | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Windows x64 | `cline-proxy-desktop.exe` | WebView2 built into Win10/11 |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `cline-proxy-desktop-darwin-arm64` | Requires Xcode CLT |
| macOS Intel | `cline-proxy-desktop-darwin-amd64` | Requires Xcode CLT |
| Linux x64 | `cline-proxy-desktop-linux-amd64` | Requires GTK3 + WebKit2GTK |

### Option 2: Command line

```bash
go build -o cline-proxy .
./cline-proxy              # default port 3457
./cline-proxy -port 8080   # custom port
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:3457/admin/ for the admin panel.

### Option 3: Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d      # build and start
docker compose logs -f    # view logs
docker compose down       # stop
```

The container listens on `0.0.0.0:3457` (`-p 3457:3457` maps it externally). The admin panel has no auth by default — do **not** expose the port to the public internet.

## Usage Guide

### 1. Add a Cline account

In the admin panel, go to **Import**:

- **OAuth browser login**: starts the device-authorization flow; complete login in your system browser (works with an already-logged-in Cline browser)
- **Manual token**: paste an existing refreshToken
- **Batch import**: upload a JSON file or paste text (one token per line, or a JSON array `[{refreshToken, email}]`)

### 2. Configure your client

```
Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:3457/v1
API Key:  <key generated in the admin panel>
Model:    <model from the synced list, e.g. stealth/ox-alpha>
```

Both OpenAI and Anthropic API formats are supported.

### 3. Account export/import (device migration)

- **Export**: click "Export" on the Accounts page to download `cline-accounts-export.json`
- **Import**: upload that file via "Import from File" on another device
- The export format is fully compatible with the batch-import format

### 4. System Prompt override

Create `override.md` next to the executable; its content replaces the system prompt for all client requests.

### 5. Listen address & access settings (LAN / multi-NIC)

By default the proxy listens on `127.0.0.1` (local only). The **Access Settings** section of the admin panel lets you:

- **Choose a listen address**: `127.0.0.1` (local) / `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) / detected local IPs; saving restarts the listener immediately
- **Admin password**: none by default; once set, `/admin/` requires a password (session cookie, 24h); save an empty field to clear it

You can also set the listen address on the command line (priority: env var > panel setting > `127.0.0.1`):

```bash
# CLI: listen on all interfaces (LAN devices can reach it via your local IP)
./cline-proxy -host 0.0.0.0

# Bind to a specific NIC
./cline-proxy -host 192.168.1.100

# Environment variable (works for the desktop app too)
CLINE_PROXY_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./cline-proxy
```

> ⚠️ **Security warning**: `/admin/` has no auth (unless you set a password). Listening on a non-loopback address (e.g. `0.0.0.0`) exposes it to your LAN. Only do this on a trusted network, or restrict port `3457` in your firewall.

### 6. Egress proxy (cross-region restrictions)

Direct requests to the Cline upstream (`api.cline.bot` / `api.workos.com`) may be region-restricted from mainland China. Configure an **application-level egress proxy** in the admin panel without enabling TUN mode on the host:

- **Cline egress proxy**: open **Upstreams → Cline Egress Proxies**, enter one proxy URL per line (`http`, `https`, `socks5`, or `socks5h`; for example `socks5://127.0.0.1:1080`). Cline requests (chat, login/token refresh, and model sync) use the configured pool with round-robin, random, or fill strategy. The setting is stored in `.cline-proxy.json` and takes effect immediately.
- **OpenCode egress proxy**: the OpenCode Zen section has a separate proxy pool for the opencode upstream and automatically cools down rate-limited exits.

Priority: application proxy > environment proxy (`HTTPS_PROXY`) > direct connection. Loopback and private-network targets (such as a local Ollama or custom Provider) always connect directly.

## Build

### Desktop app (single-file, cross-platform)

Wails requires the native WebView of each platform — build on each target system:

```bash
# Windows (this machine)
./desktop/build.sh

# macOS
xcode-select --install
./desktop/build.sh

# Linux
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev
./desktop/build.sh
```

### CI builds

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers GitHub Actions to build and release all three platforms:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Release zip (recommended for cloud-drive sharing)

Browsers are less likely to block a zip than a bare exe:

```bash
./desktop/build.sh && ./desktop/dist.sh
# Produces desktop/dist/ccline2api-windows-amd64.zip
```

## Data Files

Files are looked up in this order: executable directory → working directory → `~/.cline2api/`.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.cline-accounts.json` | Account pool, API keys, custom models and default model |
| `.cline-request-logs.json` | Request logs |
| `.cline-proxy.json` | Cline egress proxy pool configuration |
| `.cline-zen.json` | OpenCode (Zen) configuration, including its egress proxy pool |
| `override.md` | System Prompt override (optional) |

> ⚠️ The account file contains plaintext refreshTokens — treat it as sensitive. Never ship it in a release package or commit it to Git.

## Available Models

**Synced dynamically by default**: on startup the proxy fetches the official Cline recommended-models endpoint (free / cline-pass / recommended). When the list changes, the admin panel shows a popup; you can also hit "Sync Models from Cline" in Settings → Available Models at any time.

- After a successful sync, the panel lists the **remote models** (hardcoded built-ins remain only as an offline fallback)
- Remote models are ready to use; you can add/remove **custom models** in the panel (items with an ✕ delete button are custom)
- Set the default model in "Proxy Config → Default Model"; if unset, it falls back to the first free model

> Built-in fallback models (used offline / when sync fails):
> `cline-free/glm-5.2`, `cline-pass/glm-5.2`, `cline-pass/deepseek-v4-flash`, `cline-pass/qwen3.7-max`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, `poolside/laguna-s-2.1:free`
